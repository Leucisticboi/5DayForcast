## Acknowledgements/References
I used Bootstrap and inline CSS for all stylization of this webpage.

Most of the JavaScript was my own creation; however, I did ask ChatGPT for input on cleaning up/simplifying some of my functions. Overall, I would say ChatGPT helped with roughly 15% of my JavaScript code.
